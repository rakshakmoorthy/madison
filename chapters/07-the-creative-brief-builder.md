# Chapter 7 — The Creative Brief Builder

The most dangerous moment in a brand project is not when the team disagrees. It is when the team agrees too quickly.

The brief template is open. The fields are there: target audience, single-minded proposition, key message, tone, mandatories. Everyone has seen this form before. The pressure to start making assets is real — there is a review on Friday, a client call next week, a campaign that needs to be in market by a date that has already been discussed. Someone starts filling in the fields. The language sounds right. The audience description is plausible. The proposition has energy. The document fills up and starts to look like a brief.

Nobody asks where any of it came from.

That is the danger. Not the blank fields. The blank fields invite work. The danger is that blank fields, under time pressure, invite confident invention — language that sounds like strategy but is assembled from pattern and plausibility rather than from evidence, commitment, and decision.

A brief built on confident invention is not a brief. It is a fluent document that defers all the real choices into the execution phase, where they will be more expensive and more damaging to change.

---

Let me be precise about what a creative brief is actually for, because the answer is less obvious than it appears.

A brief is not primarily a communication artifact. It is a decision surface. It records the choices the team has made before any assets are built: what this work is trying to do, for whom, with what claim, supported by what proof, constrained by what mandatories, approved by whom. These choices belong on the brief because they are the choices that will be implicit in every asset the team produces. If they are not made explicitly and recorded somewhere, they will be made implicitly — by the writer, by the designer, by whoever is holding the file at the moment — and they will be made differently by different people, and the campaign will drift.

The brief is where drift is prevented. That is its function. Not to inspire the team. Not to impress the client. To record the decisions that every downstream asset depends on, so that those decisions are made once, by people with appropriate authority, at the right time.

This means a brief that is not based on decisions is not functioning as a brief. It is functioning as a placeholder — a document that has the shape of a brief while deferring the actual choices into a future that may never arrive cleanly.

---

There is a specific mechanism by which AI-assisted brief-writing goes wrong, and it is worth examining precisely.

When you ask a language model to help draft a creative brief, it does what language models do: it pattern-matches to the form. It knows what brief fields typically contain. It knows the cadence of an audience description, the grammar of a proposition, the register of a key insight. It will produce language that fits all of these slots credibly and quickly. The brief will look finished.

The problem is that the model is filling in the form from its training distribution, not from your evidence. When it writes *"Our audience is time-pressed professionals who are skeptical of corporate messaging,"* it is not lying. It is generating a sentence that has high probability given the surrounding context. It would generate a similar sentence if your audience were retirees who distrust digital advertising, because the sentence-shape fits the field-shape regardless of the specifics.

This is not a reason to avoid AI assistance in brief-writing. It is a reason to treat every AI-generated field as a draft that requires status labeling before it can be treated as strategy.

Status labeling is simple. Every field in the brief carries one of four tags. Confirmed means the field reflects approved organizational inputs — a signed objective, a research report, a documented brand rule. Inferred means the field reflects a reasonable interpretation of available evidence, but the evidence does not directly support the claim and the interpretation has not been reviewed. Unknown means the team does not currently have the information needed to fill this field with any confidence, and the field should say so. Approval-needed means the field contains a strategic choice that has not yet been made by someone with authority to make it.

A brief with these labels on every field looks very different from a brief with none. The labeled version shows you exactly where the work is finished and where it isn't. The unlabeled version shows you nothing except the form.

---

Now I want to walk through what each major brief field actually requires, because the evidence threshold varies by field and most practitioners have never been told what it is.

The **objective** field should reflect an approved organizational commitment. Not what the team hopes the campaign will achieve — what the organization has decided it is trying to do, at what scale, by what date, measured how. If this has not been decided and documented, the objective field should be labeled Unknown, not filled in with aspirational language. An inferred objective is a campaign waiting for someone to realize it was never actually agreed upon.

The **audience** field is the one most frequently filled by confident invention. A good audience field names a specific, bounded group and points to evidence that this group exists, is relevant to the brand's commercial goals, and behaves in the way the brief claims they do. The evidence can be primary research, platform analytics, CRM data, sales team observations, or well-reasoned inference from public data — but it should be named and accessible. If the audience description cannot be tied to any source, it is at best Inferred and probably Unknown. The creative team should not be building assets for an audience that has not been verified.

The **insight** field is where inference is most legitimate and most dangerous. An insight is a non-obvious truth about the audience that creates an opening for the brand. Genuine insights are rare and usually come from close observation of behavior — the thing people do that contradicts what they say, the tension between what they want and what they settle for, the moment when a category's standard offer fails them. AI is useful for surfacing candidate insights from interview transcripts, survey data, and behavioral logs. It is not a source of insights, because insights are observations about a specific audience's specific behavior, not generalizations from training data. Every insight in a brief should be labeled Inferred at best, and the team should be able to describe the evidence it rests on.

The **single-minded proposition** is the claim the brand is making. This field has a specific evidence requirement that is often missed: the proposition should not outrun the proof. If the brand is claiming it is the most trusted in its category, there should be evidence supporting that trust claim — a study, an award, a track record. If the brand is claiming that its product delivers a specific outcome, the proof should exist and be available. A proposition that outpaces its proof is not a strategy. It is a legal and reputational exposure disguised as brand positioning. This field should be labeled Approval-needed until someone with commercial and legal authority has reviewed both the claim and the available support.

The **tone** field and the **mandatories** field are different in character. Tone is a taste judgment — it should be owned by a named person with brand authority, not left as a model suggestion that no one has actually approved. Mandatories are constraints: required elements, prohibited language, regulatory requirements, channel specifications. These should be Confirmed, meaning they come from a documented source. A mandatory that was inferred or invented is not a mandatory — it is a guess about what the organization requires, and it will cause problems the first time it is wrong.

![A vertical list of six brief fields — Objective, Audience, Insight, Single-Minded Proposition, Tone, Mandatories — each mapped to the status it should reach, with the Proposition row accented as the highest-exposure field.](../images/07-the-creative-brief-builder-fig-02.png)
*Figure 7.2 — Brief fields and their evidence thresholds*

---

The assumption register is the companion artifact to the brief, and in Madison's architecture it is equally important.

An assumption register is a list of every Inferred or Unknown field in the brief, with a proposed method for resolution. If the audience field is Inferred, the register records what would be needed to confirm it: a specific analysis, a specific research question, a specific person to ask. If the proposition is Approval-needed, the register names the person whose approval is required and records whether it has been sought.

The register does three things. It makes the brief's gaps visible rather than hidden. It assigns accountability for closing each gap — which means someone's name is attached to each open question. And it creates a record that can be reviewed after the campaign, when the team is trying to understand why something worked or didn't.

A brief without a register is a document that looks complete. A brief with a register may look incomplete, because the register makes the gaps explicit. This is a feature, not a problem. A brief that accurately represents its own incompleteness is more useful than one that hides it inside confident language.

| Field | Draft content | Status | Evidence or source | Resolution owner | Resolved? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Objective | Grow qualified trial sign-ups 20% by Q3 | Confirmed | Signed FY plan, p.4 | VP Marketing | Yes |
| Audience | Time-pressed ops leads at 50–500-person firms | Inferred | CRM segment + sales notes; no primary research | Research lead | No |
| Insight | They trust peers over vendors at the evaluation stage | Inferred | 6 interview transcripts | Strategy | No |
| Single-minded proposition | "The fastest tool to first value" | Approval-needed | Benchmark exists; not legally reviewed | Legal + VP | No |
| Tone | Direct, plain, low-hype | Confirmed | Brand voice guide v3 | Brand lead | Yes |
| Mandatories | Logo lockup, accessibility AA, no "guarantee" | Confirmed | Brand + legal standards doc | Brand ops | Yes |

*Every field carries a status. The brief that hides its gaps inside confident language is not finished — it is unlabeled.*

---

There is a gate that separates the brief from asset generation, and it is the most important gate in this workflow.

The gate condition is simple: no downstream asset work treats an Inferred or Unknown field as approved strategy. This means that before the creative team starts writing headlines or designing layouts, someone with appropriate authority has reviewed the brief, acknowledged the open fields, and either resolved them or explicitly accepted the risk of proceeding without resolution.

The second option — proceeding with known gaps — is sometimes the right call. Timelines are real. Perfect information is never available. The organization may have good reasons to proceed with an inferred audience or an unconfirmed proposition. What Madison requires is that this decision be made explicitly, by a named person, with the gaps visible. The decision to proceed despite open fields is a legitimate strategic choice. The failure is when the gaps are invisible and the decision is made by default — when the brief moves forward simply because no one noticed that the fields were never confirmed.

The approval record belongs in the brief or the log: who reviewed it, when, and what status each field had at the time of approval. This is not bureaucracy. It is the minimum traceable record that lets the organization learn from the campaign after it runs.

I want to say something about the strategic tension in a brief, because it is the element that AI is most likely to flatten.

The best briefs are not comfortable documents. They hold a tension: the brand wants to say X, but the audience currently believes Y, and the campaign has to move people from Y toward X without losing them in the middle. That tension is the engine of the creative work. It is what gives the team something to solve rather than just something to illustrate.

Language models produce comfortable briefs. They produce propositions that sound good, audiences that are receptive, insights that are flattering. They do this because flattering, coherent, comfortable language has high probability in their training data. The tension — the honest acknowledgment that the brand has a problem to solve, that the audience is resistant or indifferent or actively skeptical — is lower probability. It requires someone to decide to include it.

That decision is the human's. Not because AI is incapable of generating tense propositions — it can, if asked specifically. But because the choice to build a campaign around an honest acknowledgment of where the brand actually stands, rather than where it wishes it stood, is a strategic commitment. It requires authority. It requires someone to accept the risk that the honest brief might be harder to execute and less comfortable to present. That is not a language problem. It is a judgment problem, and it belongs to the people who are accountable for the campaign.

---

The practical shape of this chapter's work is a one-page brief with an assumption register attached.

The brief has all the standard fields. Each field is labeled with its status. The audience field has a source path or a note that says the source is missing. The proposition has a note about what evidence supports it or a flag that it is Approval-needed. The insight is labeled Inferred with a description of the evidence it rests on.

The assumption register has one row for every Inferred or Unknown field. Each row names the field, describes what would be needed to resolve it, and assigns a name.

If the evidence is thin, write that. Do not write a brief that sounds confident when the underlying work has not been done. A brief that accurately describes the state of your knowledge — including what is missing — is more useful to the creative team, more honest with the client, and more legible to the organization after the campaign runs.

---

The brief says what the work is trying to do. It does not say how the organization will know whether the work is working. That is a different set of decisions, requiring different evidence and different accountabilities. It is the subject of the next chapter.

<!-- LLM EXERCISE -->
**Exercise for further inquiry.** Take any creative brief you have produced or received in the last six months. Go through each field and apply the four-status label: Confirmed, Inferred, Unknown, or Approval-needed. For every field that is not Confirmed, write one sentence describing what would be required to move it to Confirmed status — what evidence, what conversation, what approval. Then ask: if the campaign had been executed against the Confirmed fields only, and the Inferred and Unknown fields had been held as open questions, what would have changed about the brief? What choices would have had to be made explicitly that were instead made by default?

## Chapter 7 Exercises: The Creative Brief Builder
**Project:** Your Own Brand Intelligence System
**This chapter adds:** a creative brief with a field-status register that labels every field verified, inferred, or needs-approval and attaches a resolution owner to each gap.
---
### Exercise 1 — When to Use AI
**The judgment:** The brief's structural and drafting work — filling fields, building the register skeleton, surfacing candidate insights — is where AI accelerates without owning the decisions.
- Drafting first-pass field content from your supplied evidence and marking each draft as provisional — *Why AI works here:* this is **constrained drafting** from inputs you provide, and you can check each draft sentence against the source it cites.
- Surfacing candidate insights from a pile of interview transcripts you paste in — *Why AI works here:* this is **extraction and summarization** over text you control, producing candidates you then accept or reject, not finished insights.
- Building the assumption register table — one row per Inferred or Unknown field with a resolution-method prompt — *Why AI works here:* this is **structuring** against a known template, where the gaps come from your status labels and the model just lays out the scaffold.

**The tell:** You know you are using AI appropriately when you can evaluate the output — when you have independent criteria to judge whether it is correct, complete, and fit for purpose.
---
### Exercise 2 — When NOT to Use AI
**The judgment:** The strategic choices a brief records — the proposition, the tension, the sign-off — are commitments that require authority and accountability the model cannot hold.
- Setting the field-status label itself (Confirmed vs. Inferred vs. Approval-needed) — *Why AI fails here:* the label is an **accountability** claim about what the organization has actually decided; a model marking a field Confirmed is asserting an approval it has no standing to assert.
- Writing the single-minded proposition and judging whether it outruns the proof — *Why AI fails here:* this is a **values and legal-exposure** call; the model will generate a confident claim regardless of whether the **ground truth** (the supporting study, award, or track record) exists.
- Choosing to build the brief around an honest strategic tension rather than a comfortable one — *Why AI fails here:* models default to flattering, low-tension language (**source adequacy** of the discomfort is missing), and the decision to accept that risk belongs to whoever is accountable for the campaign.

**The tell:** You know you have crossed the line when you are using AI output as your reason for a conclusion rather than as a tool for reaching one.
**Series connection:** Tier 6 — the brief is a decision surface where AI drafts and the human commits; the status labels and sign-off are the mechanism that keeps the human accountable for every strategic choice the model only drafted.
---
### Exercise 3 — LLM Exercise
**What you're building this chapter:** a one-page creative brief with a field-status register and an attached assumption register — the third verified component in your brand repo.
**Tool:** Claude Project. A Project is right here because the brief should draw on the verified evidence audit (Ch 5) and competitor matrix (Ch 6) you have already built; loading those as Project knowledge lets the brief cite real sources instead of inventing them.
**The Prompt:**
```
You are helping me draft a creative brief as a DECISION SURFACE, not a finished document. Every field must carry a status label: Confirmed (reflects an approved, documented input), Inferred (reasonable interpretation of evidence, not yet reviewed), Unknown (we lack the information), or Approval-needed (a strategic choice not yet made by someone with authority).

Use only the evidence I provide or that is in this Project's knowledge (my evidence audit and competitor matrix). Do not import facts from your training data into any field.

BRAND FACTS:
- Objective (and is it documented/signed?): [FILL IN]
- Audience evidence available: [FILL IN]
- Insight evidence (transcripts, behavior, etc.): [FILL IN]
- Proposition under consideration + proof that exists: [FILL IN]
- Tone authority (who owns it) + brand voice doc: [FILL IN]
- Mandatories source: [FILL IN]

Produce two artifacts:
1. A one-page brief with fields: Objective, Audience, Insight, Single-Minded Proposition, Tone, Mandatories. For EACH field give: draft content, status label, and the evidence/source it rests on (or "no source" if none).
2. An ASSUMPTION REGISTER: one row for every Inferred, Unknown, or Approval-needed field, with columns Field | What's needed to resolve it | Resolution owner (leave as [assign] for me to fill) | Resolved? (No).

Rules: do not mark any field Confirmed unless I gave you a documented, approved source. Default to Inferred or Unknown when evidence is thin. Flag the proposition as Approval-needed unless I told you it has been legally and commercially reviewed. Where the honest brief requires acknowledging a strategic tension (brand wants X, audience believes Y), name the tension rather than smoothing it.
```
**What this produces:** a status-labeled one-page brief plus a companion assumption register that makes every gap visible and assignable, with the proposition correctly held at Approval-needed until reviewed.
**How to adapt this prompt:** *For your own brand:* load your real evidence audit and competitor matrix into the Project first, then fill BRAND FACTS from documented sources — the labels are only honest if the underlying inputs are real. *For ChatGPT / Gemini:* paste the evidence audit and matrix inline at the top of the prompt instead of using Project knowledge; if the model over-marks fields Confirmed, add "show me the exact source quote for any Confirmed label." *For a Claude Project:* keep this as your standing brief-builder Project and add your organization's field-status definitions and sign-off roles as knowledge so every brief inherits the same discipline.
**Connection to previous chapters:** the Audience and Insight fields draw their status directly from the Chapter 5 four-list sort and the Chapter 6 matrix — an audience claim that was Can Suggest there cannot be Confirmed here. **Preview of next chapter:** the brief says what the work is trying to do; Chapter 8's measurement plan turns the objective field into KPIs tied to decisions, so a vague or Unknown objective here surfaces as an un-measurable KPI there.
---
### Exercise 4 — CLI Exercise
**What you're building this chapter:** a `creative-brief.md` with an embedded field-status register and a separate `assumption-register.md`, generated from a `brief-inputs.md` in your repo.
**Tool:** Claude Code.
**Skill level:** Intermediate — reading inputs, producing two linked files, and enforcing a status-label rule.
**Setup:**
- [ ] Brand repo with `brief-inputs.md` listing each field's draft content and its documented source (or "no source").
- [ ] The verified `evidence-audit.md` and `competitor-matrix.md` from Chapters 5–6 present in the repo for cross-reference.
- [ ] Claude Code started in the repo folder.
**The Task:**
```
Read brief-inputs.md, evidence-audit.md, and competitor-matrix.md. Treat all three as read-only — do NOT modify them.

Create two files:
1. creative-brief.md — a one-page brief with fields Objective, Audience, Insight, Single-Minded Proposition, Tone, Mandatories. For each field write: draft content, a status label (Confirmed / Inferred / Unknown / Approval-needed), and the source it rests on.
2. assumption-register.md — a markdown table with one row per Inferred / Unknown / Approval-needed field: Field | What's needed to resolve | Resolution owner | Resolved?

Rules:
- Mark a field Confirmed only if brief-inputs.md gives a documented, approved source. If the source is "no source" or missing, mark Inferred or Unknown — never Confirmed.
- Mark the Single-Minded Proposition Approval-needed unless brief-inputs.md states it has been legally and commercially reviewed.
- Do not invent sources or audience facts. Where the Audience or Insight field draws on the evidence audit or matrix, cite the specific row/claim.
- Leave Resolution owner as [assign] — do not invent names.

Then print a verification summary to the chat: count of fields per status, and a list of any field marked Confirmed with the source you used. Stop after the summary. Do not delete or overwrite any other file.
```
**Expected output:** two new files — a status-labeled brief and an assumption register — plus a chat summary tallying fields per status and listing the source behind each Confirmed label.
**What to inspect in the output:** verify no field is Confirmed without a real documented source in `brief-inputs.md`, confirm the proposition is Approval-needed unless explicitly reviewed, and check that every Inferred/Unknown field has a matching row in the assumption register.
**If it goes wrong:** if a field is marked Confirmed on thin evidence, re-run with "for every Confirmed field, quote the exact source line from brief-inputs.md; if you cannot, downgrade to Inferred." If it invented a resolution owner, restate the [assign] rule.
**CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md note:** add to `CLAUDE.md`: "Brief rule: no field is Confirmed without a documented, approved source; the proposition stays Approval-needed until legal/commercial review; every non-Confirmed field gets an assumption-register row with an owner. Never invent sources or owner names."
---
### Exercise 5 — AI Validation Exercise
**What you're validating:** the `creative-brief.md` and `assumption-register.md` from Exercise 4 (or the Exercise 3 brief and register).
**Validation type:** field-status integrity and gap-visibility check. **Risk level:** High — an over-confident Confirmed label sends the creative team building against unverified strategy.
**Setup:** open the brief and register next to `brief-inputs.md` and your verified Ch 5–6 artifacts, so you can test each status label against its claimed source.
**The Validation Task:** "Evaluate the AI output using this checklist. For each item record Pass / Fail / Cannot determine and explain."
```
Validation Checklist — The Creative Brief Builder
□ Correctness: Does each field's status label match the actual strength of its source?
□ Completeness: Does every field carry a status, and does every Inferred/Unknown/Approval-needed field have an assumption-register row?
□ Scope: Does the brief stay within supplied evidence, with no audience or insight facts imported from training data?
□ Status integrity: Is every Confirmed label backed by a documented, approved source, and is the proposition held at Approval-needed until reviewed?
□ Gap visibility: Are the register rows specific about what would resolve each gap and who owns it (or [assign])?
□ Failure mode check: fluent-but-wrong (a comfortable brief that hides the real strategic tension)? a field marked Confirmed by default? missing ground truth (a proposition outrunning its proof)?
```
**What to do with your findings:** each Fail or Cannot determine becomes a correction — downgrade an over-confident label, add a missing register row, or restore the strategic tension the draft smoothed away. The corrected brief and register are the verified component you commit for this chapter.
**AI Use Disclosure prompt:** "AI drafted the brief fields and assumption register from inputs and verified artifacts I supplied, labeling each field's status and flagging the proposition as Approval-needed; I checked every Confirmed label against its source, assigned the resolution owners, and accepted accountability for the strategic choices. The model could not determine whether the proposition's proof was legally sufficient, so that field was held at Approval-needed pending review."
**Series connection:** the failure mode is a fluent-but-wrong brief that looks finished while hiding unconfirmed fields and a flattened tension; the status labels and register are the Tier 6 mechanism that keeps the human accountable for what was only drafted.
