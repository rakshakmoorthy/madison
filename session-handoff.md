# Session Handoff — Madison

## Goal (one line)
Keep Madison (a Snickerdoodle branding/marketing domain) current; finish the *Madison Plus One* manuscript.

## State now — 2026-06-15
- **Done:** Repo brought up to the CLI-agnostic standard — portable layer (`_MANIFEST.md`, `.ai/manifest.yaml`, `PROJECT_RULES.md`, `status.md`, this file); CLI-agnostic tool shims generated from `instructions/` (Gemini/Aider/Copilot/Cursor + AGENTS/CLAUDE); `scripts/manifest-check.mjs` wired into `npm run verify` and CI; `eval/` §19 harness ported. All three siblings (Mycroft, the-reallocation-engine, Madison) now match.
- **In progress:** Manuscript — first-pass chapters written; editorial expansion pending.
- **Blocked:** nothing.

## Key decisions
- `SNICKERDOODLE.md` is the constitution and governs; Madison is a domain on the Snickerdoodle framework.
- Tool shims are generated, never hand-edited (rebuild via `node scripts/build-instructions.mjs --promote`).
- Portable layer is a thin index over the existing system — no content moved.

## Next 1–3 actions
1. Editorial pass on chapters (worked examples, diagrams, exercises).
2. Promote/verify recipes past DRAFT with logged runs + gate decisions.
3. Run the `eval/` suite for real (full vs baseline) on the primary tool, then act on the scorecard.

## Files that matter (and only these)
- canonical: `SNICKERDOODLE.md`, `DOMAIN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `status.md`, `logs/RUN_LOG.md`
- touch next: `instructions/madison.md` (then rebuild), `chapters/`

## Do NOT
- Edit `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/tool shims by hand (generated — edit `instructions/`, then rebuild).
- Load `scripts/|docs/|data/madison-main/` as source (quarantined Tier 3).
- Commit `people/`, `brand/private-reflection.md`, `logs/student-recipe-evidence/`, or `.env`.
