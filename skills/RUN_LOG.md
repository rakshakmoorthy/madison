## 2026-06-18 -- Snickerdoodle audit + standardize Threadline recipe

- **Skill:** `/snickerdoodle` recipe audit and standardization (spec-first origin).
- **Inputs:** `recipes/recipe_KrishnaMoorthy.md` (Threadline); governing files `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md` (`recipes/README.md` absent — noted as gap). Four human-supplied known gaps pre-seeded.
- **Commands:** Read governing files + target recipe; classified origin/sections; rewrote to standard recipe format; inserted typed `[TODO]`s inline; produced audit summary; renamed `threadline-standardized.md` over the original after human confirmation.
- **Outputs:** Standardized `recipes/recipe_KrishnaMoorthy.md` (Purpose, Inputs table, 6 named/testable Phase Gates, 9 Steps with script paths, Output Contract, Stop Conditions, full Snickerdoodle section); this log entry.
- **Result:** STATUS DRAFT. 8 typed TODOs (2 DATA SOURCE, 2 DEFINE, 1 DEV, 2 APPROVE, 1 REPORT FIELD). Snickerdoodle section added (was absent). Audit caught a non-pre-seeded bug: Step 3 Reddit GIGO allowlist omits diabetes subreddits, so diabetes records would be silently rejected.
- **Open issues:** Top sample-mode blocker is the missing aggregation script (DEV, Step 5), which breaks the Layer 3→4 chain; per-condition threshold and diabetes allowlist (DEFINE) also block sample mode. Live mode additionally needs diabetes/collection DATA SOURCE work, two APPROVE sign-offs, and population-figure citations (REPORT FIELD). Not yet ready for `/claude` Boondoggle Score until TODOs close. New recipe file is untracked in git.

## 2026-06-06 -- Convert pantry n8n workflows to Madison recipes

- **Skill:** n8n workflow conversion to Madison recipe/conductor/report/script artifacts.
- **Inputs:** Ten n8n workflow JSON files in `pantry/`; existing Madison recipe conventions in `recipes/`, `conductor/`, and `reports/templates/`.
- **Commands:** Generated recipe, conductor, report template, and node-level Python adapters; compiled all scripts; scanned for hardcoded credentials and external-read imports outside ingest.
- **Outputs:** `logs/n8n-pantry-conversion-summary.json`, ten new recipe files, ten new conductor files, ten new report templates, and 98 new scripts across `scripts/ingest/`, `scripts/gigo/`, and `scripts/tools/`.
- **Result:** Conversion complete; 138 total Madison ingest/gigo/tool scripts compile with zero failures; no credential literals or GIGO/tool network imports found.
- **Open issues:** Generated adapters are deterministic local handoff implementations; live external source calls and production side effects still require dialogic test runs and explicit human approval.

## 2026-06-06 -- Rename and sharpen pantry n8n recipes

- **Skill:** Human-readable recipe correction for converted pantry n8n workflows.
- **Inputs:** User review feedback, ten converted pantry recipes, source n8n JSON node URLs/paths/code labels.
- **Commands:** Rewrote recipe titles, slugs, source inventories, node classifications, phase gates, human checks, conductor steps, report templates, and node-level script names; redacted credential-bearing source URLs; recompiled scripts; rescanned credentials and GIGO/tool network imports.
- **Outputs:** Meaningful workflow names such as `data-center-hiring-signal-monitor`, `brand-reputation-news-intelligence-pipeline`, and `accessibility-standards-and-rules-monitor`; refreshed `logs/n8n-pantry-conversion-summary.json`.
- **Result:** Correction complete; 135 total Madison ingest/gigo/tool scripts compile with zero failures; no credential literals or GIGO/tool network imports found in generated recipe/script surfaces.
- **Open issues:** Original n8n JSON files remain untouched and may still contain submitted machine paths or embedded credentials; recipes mark those as human-gated `[TO DO]` replacements before live execution.

## 2026-06-06 -- Build comprehensive student project recipes

- **Skill:** Student-level Madison project recipe synthesis from workflows, documentation PDFs, CSVs, HTML reports, and zip outputs.
- **Inputs:** Pantry A2/A3/A4 PDFs, n8n JSON workflows, CSV outputs, HTML reports, and expanded zip submissions for ten students.
- **Commands:** Extracted PDF text with bundled `pypdf`, summarized CSVs with bundled `pandas`, parsed HTML/zip artifacts, built per-student evidence caches under `logs/student-recipe-evidence/`, and wrote one stranger-readable recipe per student under `recipes/students/`.
- **Outputs:** Ten student recipes plus `logs/student-recipes-summary.json`.
- **Result:** Student recipes created with student name, project purpose, long-term goal, evidence inventory, data sources, verification, quality checks, step-by-step AI/human workflow, reports/logs, phase gates, stop conditions, and `[TO DO]` production gaps.
- **Open issues:** Several original submissions contain local machine paths, zipped artifacts, row-count discrepancies, or embedded credentials in source workflows; student recipes flag these as `[TO DO]` before production.
