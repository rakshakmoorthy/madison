# Retail And AI Market News Monitor

## Purpose

Combines Amazon company news, TechCrunch AI stories, and CNBC business RSS into a cleaned market-intelligence feed. The business question is: what signals from these specific sources are reliable enough for a human boss to use in market news monitoring decisions?

## Source Inventory

| Source Node | Node Type | Source URL or Path | Human Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| Amazon News RSS | `rssFeedRead` | `https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/rss` | Confirm source is allowed, current, and rate-safe before live fetch. |
| TechCrunch AI RSS | `rssFeedRead` | `https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/feed/` | Confirm source is allowed, current, and rate-safe before live fetch. |
| CNBC Business RSS | `rssFeedRead` | `https://www.cnbc.com/id/10001147/device/rss/rss.html` | Confirm source is allowed, current, and rate-safe before live fetch. |

| Node Name | Node Type | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| When clicking 'Execute workflow' | `manualTrigger` | conductor |
| Amazon News RSS | `rssFeedRead` | ingest |
| Merge | `merge` | conductor |
| Data Cleanup | `set` | gigo |
| TechCrunch AI RSS | `rssFeedRead` | ingest |
| CNBC Business RSS | `rssFeedRead` | ingest |
## Inputs

| Input | Type | Source | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Original n8n workflow JSON | JSON | [TODO: DATA SOURCE] Restore or move original workflow JSON to a repo-local path. Last documented path: pantry/pokalegayatri_333110_41799405_Pokale_Gayatri_A3_Workflow.json | Yes |
| Amazon News RSS | Source payload | `https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/rss` | Yes |
| TechCrunch AI RSS | Source payload | `https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/feed/` | Yes |
| CNBC Business RSS | Source payload | `https://www.cnbc.com/id/10001147/device/rss/rss.html` | Yes |

## Phase Gates

1. Source gate: All required source paths are present or explicitly marked with a typed TODO. Test: `test -f "recipes/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor.md" && rg -n "\[TODO: DEFINE]" "recipes/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor.md" || true`. Human capacity: [TO].
2. Scope gate: The run declares `sample` mode or an approved live mode before ingest begins. Test: `python3 -m json.tool data/raw/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor/run-envelope.json`. Human capacity: [PF].
3. Data-shape gate: Every raw and verified JSON output parses before downstream scripts run. Test: `find data/raw/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor data/verified/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor -name "*.json" -print -exec python3 -m json.tool {} \;`. Human capacity: [PA].
4. Script-readiness gate: Every step script exists or is represented by a typed development TODO. Test: `test -f scripts/ingest/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor-ingest-inputs.py || rg --fixed-strings "[TODO: DEV]" "recipes/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor.md"`. Human capacity: [IJ].
5. Approval gate: Live network calls, external writes, credentials, production databases, emails, dashboards, publishing, or model calls with sensitive data require an approval record. Test: `test -f logs/gate-decisions/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor-approval.json || rg --fixed-strings "[TODO: APPROVE]" "recipes/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor.md"`. Human capacity: [EI].
6. Report gate: Agent log and human report are written with the required fields and sections. Test: `test -f logs/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor-[DATE].json && test -f reports/generated/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor-[DATE].md`. Human capacity: [TO].

## Output Contract

### Agent output
File: `logs/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor-[DATE].json`
Fields: workflow, run_id, mode, steps_completed, records_seen, rejects, duplicates, flags, stop_conditions, todo_items, source_files, gate_decisions, generated_at, raw_output_paths, verified_output_paths, report_path.

### Human report
File: `reports/generated/retail-and-ai-market-news-monitor-[DATE].md`
Reader: domain lead or human boss responsible for accepting the `Retail And AI Market News Monitor` run.
Decision enabled: approve the run for the next phase, request source/schema fixes, or block live execution.
Sections: run summary, purpose, source inventory, inputs used, phase-gate results, steps completed, records seen, rejects, duplicates, flags, typed TODOs, human approvals, verified findings, inferred findings, decision recommendation.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if the recipe title or purpose does not match the original workflow intent.
- Stop if `pantry/pokalegayatri_333110_41799405_Pokale_Gayatri_A3_Workflow.json` is missing or cannot be parsed.
- Stop if a source URL/path is unknown, stale, private, machine-specific, credential-bearing, or not approved; add `[TODO: APPROVE] replace source` and halt live mode.
- Stop if the workflow does not define critical fields for validation; add `[TODO: DEFINE] define required fields` before production.
- Stop if GIGO outputs do not expose record counts, rejects, duplicates, or missing fields.
- Stop if a final claim is not traceable to source or verified records.
- Stop if generated reports would expose credentials, private tokens, private local paths, or unapproved personal data.
- Stop if any live model, database, email, dashboard, file export, or API write is requested without explicit human approval.

## Existing Recipe Notes Preserved For Implementation

### Extracted Notes

Combines Amazon company news, TechCrunch AI stories, and CNBC business RSS into a cleaned market-intelligence feed. The business question is: what signals from these specific sources are reliable enough for a human boss to use in market news monitoring decisions?
