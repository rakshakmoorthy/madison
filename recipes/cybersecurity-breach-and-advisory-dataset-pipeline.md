# Cybersecurity Breach And Advisory Dataset Pipeline

## Purpose

Normalizes local breach records, CISA advisories, and Kaggle cybersecurity dataset-catalog records into clean and rejected cybersecurity data outputs. The business question is: what signals from these specific sources are reliable enough for a human boss to use in cybersecurity dataset curation decisions?

## Source Inventory

## Phase Gates

1. Source gate: All required source paths are present or explicitly marked with a typed TODO. Test: `test -f "recipes/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline.md" && rg -n "\[TODO: DEFINE]" "recipes/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline.md" || true`. Human capacity: [TO].
2. Scope gate: The run declares `sample` mode or an approved live mode before ingest begins. Test: `python3 -m json.tool data/raw/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline/run-envelope.json`. Human capacity: [PF].
3. Data-shape gate: Every raw and verified JSON output parses before downstream scripts run. Test: `find data/raw/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline data/verified/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline -name "*.json" -print -exec python3 -m json.tool {} \;`. Human capacity: [PA].
4. Script-readiness gate: Every step script exists or is represented by a typed development TODO. Test: `test -f scripts/ingest/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline-ingest-inputs.py || rg --fixed-strings "[TODO: DEV]" "recipes/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline.md"`. Human capacity: [IJ].
5. Approval gate: Live network calls, external writes, credentials, production databases, emails, dashboards, publishing, or model calls with sensitive data require an approval record. Test: `test -f logs/gate-decisions/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline-approval.json || rg --fixed-strings "[TODO: APPROVE]" "recipes/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline.md"`. Human capacity: [EI].
6. Report gate: Agent log and human report are written with the required fields and sections. Test: `test -f logs/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline-[DATE].json && test -f reports/generated/cybersecurity-breach-and-advisory-dataset-pipeline-[DATE].md`. Human capacity: [TO].
